Hi! I'm [Vaibhav Balloli](https://vballoli.github.io/), final year undergrad at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. Through this blog, I aim on tracking my journey in Reinforcement Learning by writing blogs, summaries, cheatsheets and Jupyter notebooks to help me and readers understand RL better. I plan on curating simple content using various textbooks, research papers, blogs and youtube channels. I hope you enjoy having posts and letting me ReeL you in!
